//! `.usmap` mappings file parser.
//!
//! A `.usmap` file is a registry of class schemas published alongside a
//! game build that lets a parser decode unversioned-property assets
//! (post UE 4.25 with `PKG_UnversionedProperties` set), where the wire
//! stream no longer carries `FPropertyTag` headers. Each schema lists
//! the class's properties in serialization order; the unversioned
//! reader walks the schema, advancing the cursor by each property's
//! type-sized payload.
//!
//! See `docs/plans/phase-2f-unversioned-properties.md` for the full
//! wire-format spec and the cross-validation against `unreal_asset`'s
//! oracle parser.
